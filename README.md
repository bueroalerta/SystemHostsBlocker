# SystemHostBlocker
A simple host blocker built for speed.

SimpleHostBlocker is an alternative to an ad blocker that works system wide, even when outside of a browser. This means it can block ads and trackers and games and keep your privacy protected. All outside sources used for gathering hosts will be included here in the Readme file and/or the host file itself.

## Blocks Ads
As well as speeding up your browser, SystemHostsBlocker also blocks ads and trackers and can prevent you from spyware, malicious ads, and popups that take up your whole page. This works by blocking the host of the ads.

## Block Malaware
SystemHostBlocker will also help your computer to say safe from malaware and spyware by blocking malicious sources and sites that may or have been proven to include malaware.

**THE MAJORITY OF THE MALAWARE SITES WERE SOURCED FROM [MALEWARE DOMAIN LIST](http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/)**
